Build a multiplayer, real-time 2v2 Battle Game using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io.

1. Project Structure

Server: index.js (Handles rooms, team assignment, roles, and game loop).

Client: public/index.html (Single file containing HTML, CSS, and Client JS).

2. The Lobby System

Screen 1: Login. Inputs for "Nickname" and "Room ID".

Logic:

Players join a specific Room ID.

Matchmaking: The first 2 players to join are Team Blue. The next 2 are Team Red.

If a 5th player tries to join, show "Room Full".

Once 4 players are present (or 2 for testing), unlock the "Start Match" button.

3. The 2v2 Combat Mechanics (The Core Loop)

Inside a Team, assign roles automatically:

Player 1: Role = STRIKER (Attacker).

Player 2: Role = GUARDIAN (Defender).

The UI Layout (Split View)

Top Bar: Enemy Team HP and Shield Bar.

Middle: The Arena (Visual representation of projectiles).

Bottom Dashboard:

My Role (Text: "YOU ARE THE STRIKER" or "YOU ARE THE GUARDIAN").

My Team HP and Shield Bar.

The Word Deck: Display 3 random words based on role.

Input Box: Fixed at the bottom (Mobile friendly).

The Mechanics

Striker Logic:

Words: Aggressive verbs (e.g., ATTACK, BURST, SHOOT, CRUSH).

Effect: When typed correctly, send damage_event to server. Server reduces Enemy Shield first. If Shield is 0, reduce Enemy HP.

Guardian Logic:

Words: Defensive terms (e.g., PROTECT, SHIELD, HOLD, REPAIR).

Effect: When typed correctly, send heal_event to server. Server adds +10 to Team Shield (Max cap 100).

Shared State: Team HP and Shield are shared between the two teammates.

4. Visual Feedback & Mobile Responsiveness

Projectile Animation: When a Striker types a word, animate a small colored ball flying from bottom to top.

Shield Effect: When a Guardian types, flash the Health Bar Blue.

Mobile Opt-in: Ensure the input field has autocomplete="off" and autocorrect="off". Use a layout that keeps the game visible when the virtual keyboard is open (use min-height and flexbox).

5. Win Condition

When a Team's HP reaches 0, the game ends.

Show a "Team Blue Wins" or "Team Red Wins" modal with a "Play Again" button.
